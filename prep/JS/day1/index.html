    <h3>Introduction to JavaScript</h3>
    <pre>
        JavaScript is an interpreted Language
        It is used to create interactive websites
        JavaScript cannot run on its own. The browser is responsible for running JavaScript code.
        we place JavaScript code within <b>script</b> tags in html
    </pre>
    <h3>JavaScript engine</h3>
    <pre>
        A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes JavaScript code and converts it into computer understandable language.
        List of JavaScript Engines:
        Browser                     Name of the JS Engine
        --------------------------------------------------
        Google Chrome	            V8
        Edge (Internet Explorer)	    Chakra
        Mozilla Firefox	            Spider Monkey
        Safari 	                           Javascript Core Webkit
    </pre>
    <h3>Execution Context</h3>
    <pre>
        Execution context is used to describe how a code works inside.
        It parses the code line by line and stores the variables and functions into the memory.
        <b>Global Execution Context</b> is the first thing that is created when you write JavaScript code.
        Whenever a function gets invoked, called, or executed, a new local execution context gets created.

    </pre>
    <h3>call stack</h3>
    <pre>
        call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle
        The call stack is synchronous.
    </pre>
    <h3>Declaration of variables in JS</h3>
    <pre>
        In JavaScript, we can declare a variable in three different ways by using <b>var, let</b> and <b>const</b> keyword.
        <b>Var</b>
              This keyword is used to declare variable globally. 
              If you used this keyword to declare variable then the variable can accessible globally and changeable also.
              It is good for a short length of codes, if the codes get huge then you will get confused.
              <i>syntax: var a = 5</i>
        <b>let</b>
              This keyword is used to declare variable locally. 
              If you used this keyword to declare variable then the variable can accessible locally and it is changeable as well.
              <i>syntax: let b = 10 </i>
        <b>const</b>
              This keyword is used to declare variable locally.
              const values can't be reassigned. So we should assign the value while declaring the variable.
              <i>syntax: const c = 30</i>
     </pre>
    <h3>Difference between undefined and not defined in Javascript</h3>
    <pre>
        <b>Undefined</b>
             <pre>
                Whenever we declare a variable without assigning any value to it, javascript implicitly assigns its value as undefined.
                Ex:
                    let name;
                    console.log(name); //undefined
             </pre>
    <b>Not define</b>
    <pre>
            A not defined is a variable which is not declared at a given point of time with declaration keyword like var, let or const.
             Ex:
                  console.log(b);
                  b = 5;
            While if we don't use var keyword the output will be:-
                   //Output:- ReferenceError: b is not defined
        </pre>
    <h3>Some errors in JS</h3>
    <i>SyntaxError: </i><p>The Javascript SyntaxError occurs when trying to interpret code that is not syntactically valid.</p>
    <i>Reference Error: </i><p>when a variable that doesn't exist (or hasn't yet been initialized) in the current scope is referenced</p>
    </pre>
    <h3>Data types in JS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>number</li>
        <li>string</li>
        <li>boolean</li>
        <li>object</li>
        <li>buffer</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>strict mode</h3>
    <p>
        The statement “use strict”; instructs the browser to use the Strict mode
    </p>
    <h3>Hoisting in JavaScript</h3>
    <pre>
        The JavaScript engine moves the variable and function declarations to the top of your code. This feature is known as hoisting in JavaScript.
        In variable hoisting keyword var is hoisted and let and const does not allow hoisting.
        Like variables, the JavaScript engine also hoists the function declarations. 
        The JavaScript engine doesn't hoist the function expressions and arrow functions.
    </pre>
    <h3>Functions in JavaScript</h3>
    <pre>
        A Function is a block of code that is designed to perform a task and executed when it is been called or invoked.
       There are 3 ways of writing a function in JavaScript:
       <b>Function Declaration</b>
        function add(a, b) {        
        console.log(a + b);
         }  
         add(2, 3);
        <b>Function Expression</b>
            const add = function(a, b) {
            console.log(a+b);
            }
             add(2, 3);
        <b>Arrow Function</b>
              It is used to shorten the code. 
              Here we do not use the “function” keyword and use the arrow symbol.
             
              let add = (a, b) => a + b;
              console.log(add(3, 2));
    </pre>
