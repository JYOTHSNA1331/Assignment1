    <h3>What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h3>
        <p>
            when we try to aceess the variables of let and const without initilizing we get an referrence error.
            The area between the variable declaration and initialization is called Temporal dead zone
        </p>

    <h3>What is the for-in loop in JavaScript? Give its syntax</h3>
    <p>For-in loop is used to iterate over object</p>
    <pre>
        let a={name:'ABC',
                salary:20000}
        for (let i in a) {
            console.log(i);
          }
    </pre>

    <h3>Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript</h3>
         <p>
            Local Scope: Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.<br>
            Block scope: variables with let and const keyword provide block scope. They are accessible only within that block<br>
            Functional Scope: local variables have functional scope.They can be accessed within that function<br>
            Scope Chain: trying to access the variable in another scope.
         </p>

    <h3>What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</h3>
    <pre>In 'undefined', we will define a variable, but we won't assign a value to that variable. On the other hand, in
        'null' we will define a variable and assign the 'null' value to the variable.
         Both are primitive data types.
         </pre>

    <h3>what is Symbol?</h3>
    <pre>
        Symbols are primitive data-type and was introduced in ES6.
        These are defined using factory function Symbol()
        They return unique Identifiers and they are immutable

        let s= Symbol("Hello")
        let p = Symbol("Hello")
        console.log(s==p) //return false

    </pre>

    <h3>Write code to explain map and filter in arrays</h3>
       <pre> Map: iterate each and every values of an array and push into another array
          let a=[1,2,3,4,5] 
          let b=a.map(n=>n*2)
          console.log(b)//[2,4,6,8,10]

        Filter: It removes the item from an array based on certain condition
             let a=[1,2,3,4,5] 
             let b=a.filter(n=>n>2)
             console.log(b)//[3,4,5] </pre>
    
    <h3>Explain passed by value and passed by reference</h3>
        <pre> Pass by value: primitive data type. we are pass the variable as an argument.A copy of variable is created.
              let a=10;
              let b=a;
              b=b+a 
              console.log(a)//10
              console.log(b)//15
         pass by reference: Non-primitive data type. we pass the address as an argument.
              
                let a =[1,2,3,4,5] 
                let b= a 
                b.push(6)
                console.log(a)//1,2,3,4,5,6
                console.log(b)//1,2,3,4,5,6 </pre>
        
    <h3>Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code</h3>
    <p>Self Invoking function are also called as immediately invoked Function Expression(IIFE)
        They are executed Immediately after their declaration</p>
    <pre>
            (function(){
               console.log("Hello World")
            })();
        </pre>

    <h3>What is an event loop and call stack</h3>
        <p>Event loop: Event loop is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. 
        Call stack maintains the "Order of execution of execution contexts".</p>
