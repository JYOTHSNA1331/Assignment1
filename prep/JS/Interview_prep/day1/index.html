  <h3>Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h3>
  <p>== checks data only while === checks value as well as data type</p>
  <h3>What is spread operator</h3>
  <p>new feature in ES6
  <p>
  <p>Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements.

  <pre>function sum(x, y, z) {
      return x + y + z;
    }
    const numbers = [10, 20, 30];
    console.log(sum(...numbers));
    console.log(sum.apply(null, numbers)); </pre>

  <h3>Difference between var,let and const</h3>
  <pre>
    var:-
         1)The scope of a var variable is functional scope.
         2)It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.
         3)It can be declared without initialization.
         4)It can be accessed without initialization as its default value is “undefined”.
         5)hoisting is supported.
        
         let:-
        
        1)The scope of a let variable is block scope.
         2)It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope.
         3)It can be declared without initialization. 
         4)It cannot be accessed without initialization otherwise it will give ‘referenceError’.
         5)Hoisting is not supported.
      
        const:-
           1)The scope of a const variable is block scope.
           2)It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope.
           3)It cannot be declared without initialization.
           4)It cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization
           5)Hoisting is not supported.
   </pre>

  <h3>Execution Context</h3>
  <pre>
      1) javascript engine creates the global execution context,before start to execute any code.
      2) variable and function that is not inside any function.A new execution context gets created on every time a function is called.
      3)declare a variable and function which all ready present in the global execution context.
      4)The environment in which the our code is executed and evaluated 
      5)It has two phases:
           ->Creation phase
           ->Execution Phase
    </pre>

  <h3>What is creation phase and execution phase?</h3>
       <pre>
        When the JavaScript engine executes a script for the first time, it creates the global execution context. During this phase, the JavaScript engine performs the following tasks:
        - Create the global object i.e., window in the web browser or global in Node.js.
        - Create the this object and bind it to the global object.
        - Setup a memory heap for storing variables and function references.
        - Store the function declarations in the memory heap and variables within the global execution context with the initial values as undefined.
        After the creation phase, the global execution context moves to the execution phase.
        During the execution phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code line by line, assigns the values to variables, and executes the function calls.
        For each function call, the JavaScript engine creates a new function execution context.
       </pre>
       
  <h3>What is meant by first class functions</h3>
  <pre> First class function,are those function which can be passed as an argument into another function or 
    can be returned from another functions,and can be assigned a value to a variable,
    they are also called as "First class citizens."</pre>

  <h3>What are closures? Give an example of closure</h3>
  <pre>
    Closure is an action that,is inner function can have access to the outer function variables and parameters, as well as all global variables.

         const outer_Function=(b)=>{
            var a=10;
            const inner_Function=()=>{
               var sum = a+b; 
                console.log("sum of the values:"+sum);
           }
           inner_Function();
         }
         outer_Function(5);
   </pre>
