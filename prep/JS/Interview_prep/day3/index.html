    <h3>What are promises and why do we need them?</h3>
    <p>Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage when dealing with
        multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improves Code Readability</li>
        <li>Better handling of asynchronous operations</li>
        <li>Better Error Handling</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
        var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
            const x = "Hello";
            const y = "Hello"
            if(x === y) {
              resolve();
            } else {
              reject();
            }
          });
             
          promise.
              then(function () {
                  console.log('Matched');
              }).
              catch(function () {
                  console.log('-1');
              });
    </pre>

    <pre>
        A promise may have one of three states.
             - Pending
             - Fulfilled
            - Rejected
A promise starts in a pending state. That means the process is not complete. 
If the operation is successful, the process ends in a fulfilled state. 
And, if an error occurs, the process ends in a rejected state.
It is also used to handle Web API calls.
</pre>

    <h3>What is the purpose of async/await keywords?</h3>
    <p>async makes a function return a Promise, await makes a function wait for a Promise</p>
    <pre>
        async function asyncFunc() {
            let result = await promise;  
            console.log(result);
            console.log("hello");
          }
          asyncFunc();
          
    </pre>

    <h3>What is hoisting?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript only hoists declarations, not the initializations.</li>
        <li>var is hoisted and let and const does not allow hoisting.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
    <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model and is a programming interface that allows us to create, change or remove
        elements from the document. We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.</p>

    <h3>Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</h3>
    <p>Undefined: In JavaScript, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value to
        it.</p>
    <p>not defined: In JavaScript, not defined means a variable is not declare or trying to access the variable out of
        scope</p>
    <p>Nan: NaN stands for Not a Number. It represents a value which is not a valid number. It can be used to check
        whether a number entered is a valid number or not a number</p>

    <h3>How many operators do we have in JS ?</h3>
    <p>There are following types of operators in JavaScript.
    <ol type="1">
        <li> Arithmetic Operators (+,-,*,/,++,--,%)</li>
        <li> Comparison (Relational) Operators</li>
        <!-- <,>,<=,>=,==,===,!=,!== -->
        <li> Bitwise Operators (&,|,^,left shifh,right shift,)</li>
        <li> Logical Operators(&&,||)</li>
        <li> Assignment Operators(+=,-=,*=)</li>
        <li> Special Operators(typeof,instanceof)</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>What is callback hell</h3>
    <p>
        Callback Hell is essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. Every
        callback depends/waits for the previous callback, thereby making a pyramid structure that affects the
        readability and maintainability of the code.
    </p>
    <h3>What is promise chaining</h3>
     <p>Promise Chaining is a simple concept by which we may initialize another promise inside our .then() method and accordingly we may execute our results.</p>
     <pre>
       
            let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
              resolve("Hello JavaScript");
            });
            promise
              .then(
                new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                  resolve("Hello world");
                }).then((result1) => {
                  console.log(result1);
                })
              )
              .then((result2) => {
                console.log(result2);
              });
            
     </pre>
     <h3>What are arrow functions?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Arrow functions are introduced in ES6, which provides you a more accurate way to write the functions in
            JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Arrow functions are anonymous functions</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
        let add = (x, y) => x + y;
        console.log(add(10, 20)); // 30;
    </pre>

    <h3>Give an example of async/await</h3>
    <pre>
        const getData = async() => {
            var y = await "Hello World";
            console.log(y);
        }
         
        console.log(1);
        getData();
        console.log(2);

        //output
        //1
        //2
        //Hello World
    </pre>
