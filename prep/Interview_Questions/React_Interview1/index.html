    <h1>What is virtual DOM</h1>
    <ul type="none">
        <li>The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of Real DOM.</li> 
        <li>The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM.</li>   
        <li>It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen.</li>   
        <li>This entire process is called reconciliation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>What is SPA</h1>
    <ul type="none">
    <li>SPA stands for Single Page Application. It is a very common way of programming websites these days.</li>
    <li>The idea is that the website loads all the HTML/JS the first time you visit.</li>      
    <li>When you then navigate, the browser will only rerender the content without refreshing the website.</li>
    <li>This is used to make the user experience feel a lot smoother.</li>      
    </ul>

    <h1>Difference between functional and class component</h1>
     <table border="1px">
        <tr>
            <th>Class Component</th>
            <th>Functional Components</th> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Class components can be used when you are doing data operations and server calls.</td>
            <td>Functional Components can be used mostly when you want to create dumb or stateless components</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Contain lifecycle methods</td>
            <td>These components does not have lifecycle methods, they have hooks like useEffect</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Constructor structure is required since these are class components.</td>
            <td>Complete constructor structure is not required in these components, so they are easy to handle</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Contains state variables</td>
            <td>Do not have state variables, they have hooks like useState</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element.</td>
            <td>A functional component is just a plain JavaScript pure function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element(JSX).</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h1>What do you mean by state and its use in react?</h1>
        <p>The state is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.state is mutable. </p>
    <h1>What is JSX and why do we use it instead of JS?</h1>
        <li>JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods.</li>
        <li>JSX converts HTML tags into react elements. </li> 
        <li>You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications.</li>
    <h1>What is Package.json?</h1>
        <li>The package. json file is the heart of any Node project.</li>
        <li> It records important metadata about a project which is required before publishing to NPM, and also defines functional attributes of a project that npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts, and identify the entry point to our package.</li>
