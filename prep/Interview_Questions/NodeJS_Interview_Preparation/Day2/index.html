    <h3> What are the different types of HTTP requests?</h3>
    <p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) specifies a collection of request methods to specify what action is to be
        performed on a particular resource. The most commonly used HTTP request methods are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GET: GET request is used to read/retrieve data from a web server.</li>
        <li>POST: POST request is used to send data (file, form data, etc.) to the server.</li>
        <li>PUT: A PUT request is used to modify the data on the server. It replaces the entire content at a particular
            location with data that is passed in the body payload.</li>
        <li>PATCH: PATCH is similar to PUT request, but the only difference is, it modifies a part of the data. It will
            only replace the content that you want to update.</li>
        <li>DELETE: A DELETE request is used to delete the data on the server at a specified location.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Explain the concept of middleware in Node.js.</h3>
    <p>Middleware gets executed after the server receives the request and before the controller actions send the
        response. Middleware has the access to the request object, responses object, and next, it can process the
        request before the server send a response. An Express-based application is a series of middleware function
        calls. The next() function in the express is responsible for calling the next middleware function if there is
        one</p>

    <h3>Explain CORS.</h3>
    <p>CORS : (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism by which data or any other resource of a site could be
        shared intentionally to a third party website when there is a need. Generally, access to resources that are
        residing in a third party site is restricted by the browser clients for security purposes.</p>

    <h3>What is Express? How it helps you to create a backend application?</h3>
    <p>Express.js: Express is a small framework that sits on top of Node.js's web server functionality to simplify its
        APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your application's functionality with
        middleware and routing. It is used to build web-apps using approaches and principles of Node.js. It requires
        less coding time.</p>

    <h3>Explain min 5 status codes gets used in Backend development.</h3>
    <p>An HTTP status code is a message a website's server sends to the browser to indicate whether or not that request
        can be fulfilled. Status codes specs are set by the W3C. Status codes are embedded in the HTTP header of a page
        to tell the browser the result of its request.</p>
    <ul>
      
        <li>Processing 200 OK OK</li>
        <li>400 BAD_REQUEST</li>
        <li>403 FORBIDDEN</li>
        <li>404 NOT_FOUND</li>
        <li>500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR</li>
        <li>503 - Service Unavailable</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Difference between HTTP and HTTPS.</h3>
    <p>HTTPS is HTTP with encryption. The only difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to
        encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP. A website that uses
        HTTP has http:// in its URL, while a website that uses HTTPS has https://.</p>

    <h3>What are JWT tokens?</h3>
    <p>JSON web token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting
        information between parties as a JSON object. JWT is a standard, meaning that all JWTs are tokens, but not all
        tokens are JWTs. when we logged-in somewhere , they provide us a unique token.which helps us to access through
        it token is provided only when the registered data and login data are matching. Ex:-facebook</p>
